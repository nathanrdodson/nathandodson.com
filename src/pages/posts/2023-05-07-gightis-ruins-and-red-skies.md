Tunisia's proximity to Europe and its status a a former piece of the Roman Empire means there are still artifacts of that government available to visit today. Not too far away from the IRA sites is a protected area called Gigthis which is a coastal township ruin from 2oo CE.

Walking through, much of the layout and structure/flow of the city is in-tact; you can view different market stalls, bathhouses, kitchen areas, latrines, and more. It doesn't take much imagination to sit yourself in the heart of a bustling Roman port, with vendors vying for your attention as you make your way to the temple in the city center.

Irrigation lines run everywhere - I am unsure where exactly they got their fresh water from, it might be wells?

There were several other columns that were more in-tact throughout the ruins.![](../../content/images/2023/05/099FD38B-BDE6-4B96-8051-F5A6F9B60232_1_105_c.jpeg)Remains of and old bathhouse. In the center, you can see what I believe to be a heating element for the hot and warm baths.![](../../content/images/2023/05/5EA98C16-8BAD-4979-8099-B21AC7AAABBC_1_105_c.jpeg)

As mentioned above, much of the internal structure can still be made out by walking around the grounds.

Eventually, you make your way to the city-center. An open, square center lined on either side with small temples with Roman deity dedications/inscriptions, with a large temple to the emperor flanking the main temple in the center.

From the top of the main staircase, there is a great view of the surrounding area as a local high point.
