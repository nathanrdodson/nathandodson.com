## *Hey! -* I'm Nathan.

I'm happy you found my home on the internet :) A little bit about myself; a Kansan at heart, I have been a student at the University of Kansas c. 2019 and am currently finishing my MBA. 

Now, I'm actively applying and looking for software development and similar technical roles for post-graduation in May of 2024. Check out my [resume](__GHOST_URL__/resume) to learn more about my professional background and past experiences.

At my core, I am a hobbyist - someone who focuses on and seeks value in my passions. From learning about the importance of movement ecology (see [my trip to Tunisia](__GHOST_URL__/tunisias-arid-ecosystems/)), to [building environmentally resilient communities](__GHOST_URL__/seeds-leadership-2022/), to photography of people/places/things, to the maintenance and development of my personal homelab, all the way to my day-to-day work as a software developer (and, right now, as a student). It is the culmination of these interests that have informed my life experience and have helped me establish my worldview.

I am a big believer in localized focus; the notion that it isn't necessarily *where* you exist, but how you apply yourself to the betterment of your greater community that adds value to your life and the lives of others.
